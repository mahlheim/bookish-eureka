## Description
This application is a content management system that runs in the command line and allows a user to manage a company's employee database through the use of Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine, install the dependencies, set up and seed your database, and then run the app from the command line by running "npm start".

## Usage
Run "npm start". The app will let you know that you are connected to the employees_db database and give you a list of options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, update and employee role, remove an employee, remove a role, remove a department, and finally, exit the app. Select your choice from the list and follow the instructions as they appear to view, add, or remove data from the database.
